# CSC790_AdvSoftResearch

This repository contains the initial implementation and experiments for my ICSE research proposal.  
The project focuses on evaluating whether automatic code generation metrics (e.g., Pass@1, CodeBLEU) align with real developer adoption in real-world settings.

## Overview

### **Stage 1: Bug-Fix Task Analysis (Python)**  
Using the DevGPT dataset:  
- âœ… PR parsing and filtering *(one snapshot explored, pipeline in Jupyter notebook)*  
- ðŸŸ¡ Time-to-integration signal extraction  
- ðŸŸ¡ Edit effort computation (ongoing)

### **Next Steps**  
- Adoption label extraction (exact / modified / unused)  
- LLM output collection  
- Metric computation (e.g., CodeBLEU)  
- Repository-level and cross-language analysis

ðŸ“Ž **Repository will be updated** as the implementation progresses through Stage 2 and Stage 3 (repository-level and cross-language analysis).
